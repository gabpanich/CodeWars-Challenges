# Codewars-Challenges
A GitHub repository to track my daily code challenges that I've solved.

Each codewar challenge solved will get its own file; including the challenge instructions, the code solution itself, and test cases.

## How It's Done:

Everyday I solve at least one codewars problem, and push to this repository.

**Languages Used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations
Sometimes I go back to old solutions and refractor my code.

## Lessons Learned:
The biggest I learned was how to break down a question. Some questions have specific wording that will change the way you solve the problem.
